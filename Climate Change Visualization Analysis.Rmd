I replicated this by using the same data and recreating the color scheme usint Tableau.

Visualization 5: CLimate Change Denyer's Response

There was a period of significant warming during medieval times that follows the trend global warming is currently taking. The previous period was, of course, prior to when humans began to inject CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere and so the current warming period is only a gradual trend that follows prior recorded data.
This is refuted by climate change proponents since the data for the waeming period was only collected in Europe and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere
